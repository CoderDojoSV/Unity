1. What is this? Who are you people? Who am I? What's going on here?!
	* This is an introductory Unity3D 'course'. Not really a course, more of a place-where-people-are-doing-the-same-kind-of-thing-at-the-same-time.
	* You should be people who:
		1. have done some development before, most likely introductory-type programming with really any language or environment.
		2. can type (mostly), feel very comfortable with a mouse, and feel comfortable with computers in general.
		3. aren't afraid of learning math concepts.
		4. want to learn more about Game Development!
	* I'm Michael V, the presenter. I'm a game developer, and undergraduate computer science professor, and author of the tutorials we'll be following in this class.
	* This class is about making a positive learning and working environment to explore a short series of tutorials I've developed for teaching Unity3D.
		1. This isn't a great place to play Minecraft, or web games, or surf the internet.
		2. If you want to learn more but feel stuck, tell me! I will do what I can to make this a better place to learn, however I can.

2. Install Unity3D on everyone's computer, and get everyone on the internet.

3. Explain how the github repo works, and get everyone to load up the first tutorial.

4. Lets make cool stuff with Unity3D now! (every day after the first probably starts with step 4)
